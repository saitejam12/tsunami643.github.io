		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Fortune's End is basically the only cheap offensive purge in the game, so here are some buffs worth
				noting that can be purged: Aphotic Shield, Surge, Ion Shell, Flame Guard, Empower, Jingu Mastery, Overpower, Ghost Scepter,
				Crimson Guard's active, and Haste/DD/Arcane/Regen (but not Invis) runes.</li>
			<li>Fortune's End also serves as a basic dispel when cast on allies.
				<a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_debuffs">Here's a list of useful things you can dispel.</a>
				tl;dr - Most silences, slows, roots, and other non-stun debuffs like Dust.</li>
			<li>Every enemy in the AoE of the Fortune's End projectile gets damaged, purged, and rooted upon landing.</li>
			<li>However, only an ally directly targeted by Fortune's End gets dispelled, not all allies in the AoE.</li>
			<li>Fortune's End provides true sight on only the primary target during the root duration.</li>
			<li>You can self-target Fortune's End. If an enemy is closing in on you, or you can't target an enemy, start channeling
				it on yourself.</li>
			<li>You can be cute and pre-channel Fortune's End on a Blinking or TPing ally so if they run into an enemy,
				you may catch someone in the root/purge AoE (or purge off something like a silence from your ally).</li>
			<li>Pre-targeting Fortune's End can also be useful to outplay silences. If you are about to enter a team fight
				and you think an enemy Silencer may use Global, start channeling Fortune's End on yourself to automatically purge
				off the silence when it cancels your channel.</li>
			<li>The damage on Fortune's End <i>does not scale</i> the longer you channel it. This isn't Powershot. Only
				the root duration scales.</li>
			<li>You can target Fortune's End on allied couriers.</li>
			<li>Break the Fortune's End channel by casting Purifying Flames on your target. This won't work if
				your target is less than 400 distance away from you since the Fortune's End projectile will land too quickly
				to purge off the heal.</li>
			<li>You can target and channel Fortune's End on any Cycloned target from an enemy Eul's to purge off the Cyclone.
				Cyclones from allied Eul's (including your own) cannot be purged, but you can still target and channel the
				Fortune's End.</li>
			<li>Eul's is a valuable item on Oracle since it adds yet another purge to your library. It's an additional dispel you can use
				to take the Purifying Flames heal off an enemy.</li>
			<li>The purge from Fortune's End can take the Fate's Edict debuff off allies and enemies. False Promise can also
				purge Fate's Edict off allies.</a>
			<li>Fate's Edict can disarm Rosh.</li>
			<li>If you use Fate's Edict on a lane creep, they immediately stop pathing and just stand around for some reason. Not very useful,
				but you could use this to stall a siege creep before it goes into tower range.</li>
			<li>Don't use Fate's Edict offensively unless you're a 100% sure your team fully understands how the spell
				works. Yes I know it's a great disarm, but people are dumb and get mad at you for making the enemy immune to magic damage.</li>
			<li>Fate's Edict and Purifying Flames both work on enemy, allied, and neutral creeps.</li>
			<li>This is core knowledge for playing Oracle: Cast Fate's Edict first on an ally before Flaming them.
				They'll be immune to <s>hurt feelings</s> the nuke damage, but still get the heal.</li>
			<li>Once maxed, each full duration Flame will give ~120 HP to a hero (enemy or ally) with standard magic
				resistance.</li>
			<li>You can cast Glimmer Cape on allies before Flaming them to reduce the nuke damage.</li>
			<li>You rarely want to cast Purifying Flames on an enemy unless you're absolutely sure you can purge
				it or you're sure you can kill the target in the next ~5 seconds (it takes 6 seconds for the heal to
				compensate the damage with standard magic resistance).</li>
			<li>However, if you have a Spirit Vessel charge placed on an enemy target, Flame away. The heal will be heavily
				reduced so you don't really have to worry about it canceling out the nuke damage.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames will never deal lethal damage to allied heroes or allied creeps/summons.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames damage can proc an ally's Aeon Disk, but not your own.</li>
			<li>You can get ninja denies on your creeps by Purifying them and then immediately going for deny attacks
				to finish them off. Or if a creep is already below 50%, toss a right click and then cast Purifying Flames
				while your attack projectile is flying.</li>
			<li>The damage on Purifying Flames allows you to wake allies sleeping under ET's Stomp or Bane's Nightmare.</li>
			<li>False Promise is your highest range spell. If you're trying to save someone who's about to die, don't bother Edicting, or
				Flaming them first, just use False Promise right off the bat.</li>
			<li>You can False Promise creep-hero units like Warlock's Golem or the Spirit Bear.</li>
			<li>The globe effect above a False Promised hero indicates the current state of damage. A fiery red orb means they'll
				<i>probably</i> die.</li>
			<li>A False Promised hero can never have their Blink Dagger broken.</li>
			<li>Healing Salves, Bottle, Urn/Spirit Vessel, and Heart's heals can't be broken by damage on a hero that's False Promised, but an
				enemy can take them off with dispels.</li>
			<li>The only ways of cheating a False Promise death are with Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Abaddon's Borrowed Time, or Troll Warlord in Battle Trance.</li>
			<li>You can theoretically dodge a False Promise death with Aeon Disk, but there are a few weird interactions to be aware of:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>If you are above the 70% HP threshold when False Promise is cast and you don't receive any single instance of damage that would've theoretically
					taken your current HP below the 70% threshold (like a Laguna Blade), then once False Promise ends the Aeon Disk will take the total damage that
					would've brought you down to 0-69% and leave you at 70% HP.</li>
				<li>If you are above the 70% HP threshold when False Promise is cast and you do receive a single instance of damage that would've theoretically
					taken your current HP below the 70% threshold, then once False Promise ends Aeon Disk will proc, reduce only that one damage instance, and
					you'll still die if you received enough damage from other sources.</li>
				<li>If you are below the 70% HP threshold when False Promise is cast on you, the very first damage instance you take will immediately
					proc the Aeon Disk even while you're False Promised. Unfortunately, being under the Combo Breaker damage reduction buff won't
					stop False Promise damage from going through. If the False Promise ending is the <i>only thing</i> to damage you when you're under 70%,
					then Aeon Disk will save you.</li>
				<li><b>Therefore, the most reliable way to dodge a False Promise death with Aeon Disk is to keep the Disk in your backpack, and then have it come
					off cooldown right before False Promise ends.</b> That way it doesn't matter what your starting HP was or how many huge nukes you took, the False Promise
					damage itself is the only thing Aeon Disk will be 'awake' for when it needs to block.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Culling Blade can kill through False Promise.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vesseling a False Promised target right before the ult ends will reduce their potential regen.
				Time it close enough so Oracle can't purge it off with Fortune's End.</li>
			<li>Shadow Demon Demonic Purging a False Promised target makes it nigh impossible for Oracle to save them
				since every heal he'll pour into his ally will get insta-dispelled.</li>
		</ul>
