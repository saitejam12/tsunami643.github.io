		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Penitence works on Roshan.</li>
			<li>Ward-type units (Serpent Wards, Death Ward, etc) and towers benefit from Penitence attack speed.</li>
			<li>Divine Favor provides a damage bonus multiplier when cast on non-hero units, including siege creeps or summons like Beastmaster's Boar
				or Invoker's Forge Spirit and even creep-hero summons like Visage's Familiars, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, or Brewmaster's
				Split Pandas.</li>
			<li>Holy Persuasion can teleport any player-owned unit, including some weird units like Brewmaster's Split Pandas, Plague Ward,
				Healing Ward, Nether Ward, Psionic Traps, Zeus's Nimbus, and all three of Techies mine types.</li>
			<li>You can also teleport your courier with Holy Persuasion, but only if it's <i>not</i> in the fountain. Couriers in fountains
				have a special type of invulnerability that stops most spells from working on them to prevent enemies from killing them in the well,
				but it also prevents Persuasion for some reason.</li>
			<li>When trying to teleport a teammate in danger with Holy Persuasion, keep in mind that if they receive any damage from a hero,
				the Recall gets canceled. Wait for your ally to run into the trees or just escape fog to initiate the Persuasion, then just
				cross your fingers that they can keep juking.</li>
			<li>Don't bring your whole entourage back to base if you need to refill HP and mana. Leave your creeps in
				the lane and try to pick up last hits, or send them to jungle/ancient camps and start stacking.</li>
			<li>The ranged Satyr's purge can target and dispel allies.</li>
			<li>The Tornado from the Wildwing Ripper does not draw aggro when used on neutral creeps, allowing you to damage an entire stack
				or kill ancients without them moving around constantly.</li>
			<li>When you lose control of a Mud Golem, it will instantly split, but you will still have control of the Shards.
				Early game you can use this to stun an enemy with the Mud Golem, Persuade a lane creep to force the split, and
				then have two more Shard Golem stuns.</li>
			<li>Persuaded enemy lane creeps will benefit from the Glyph invulnerability.</li>
			<li>Agh's allows you to control 3 Ancients when Hand of God is maxed, but you're still allowed more normal creeps. Don't forget about
				Alpha Wolves and Kobolds and other useful aura creeps after you amass an ancient army.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Damaging a unit that's being teleported under Holy Persuasion cancels the teleport.</li>
			<li>Consider getting a Midas or Helm of the Dominator if you're up against a Chen. Watch him fumble through
				his control groups before he realizes that you turned his Satyr into your Ogre Club.</li>
			<li>Heroes with spells that notably affect creeps are big counters against Chen. Crystal Maiden's Frostbite,
				Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask, Doom's Devour, and Lifestealer's Infest are a few specific examples.</li>
			<li>Diffusal Blade can root creeps.</li>
