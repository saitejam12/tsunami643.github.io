		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Bloodrage increases <i>all</i> damage dealt to/from a hero. This means that spells and items will also
				deal increased damage if a hero is Bloodraged.</li>
			<li>You can Bloodrage allied or enemy creeps right before they die and lifesteal off the last hit if you
				don't want to risk casting it on yourself.</li>
			<li>At level 2 Bloodrage, you can cast the spell on yourself and a target to double-heal when you kill it.</li>
			<li>Bloodrage can be used to pop Linken's if enemies are trying to block your Rupture.</li>
			<li>Bloodrage damage amp works on Roshan. Please warn the person who's tanking Rosh before you use it, though.</li>
			<li>Blood Rite provides ground vision around its AoE.</li>
			<li>Enemies can't easily use Blink Dagger if they're Ruptured. It has a pretty long cast range and the
				debuff lasts a ridiculously long time, so it can be useful to mess with Blinks from an initiator
				like Tidehunter or Magnus before a team fight begins.</li>
			<li>Blade Mail can be a worthwhile pickup against Lotus Orbs to force a target to take Rupture damage if
				you have HP to burn.</li>
			<li>Agh's Rupture charges don't stack when cast on the same target, it'll just refresh the duration. What'd you expect,
				they'll bleed twice as hard? C'mon now.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>TP scroll. Seriously. Just TP out if he's ganking you. He can't do anything about it.</li>
			<li>Consider getting a Magic Stick against Bloodseeker. Chances are he's going to be spamming Bloodrage like
				crazy in lane and each cast will give you a charge.</li>
			<li>Get a Mek or Urn on your team and carry around lots of regen. If BS isn't getting Thirsty in team fights,
				he can't deal much damage.</li>
			<li>Spirit Vessel is so outrageously value against a BS, it's not even funny. Vessel him before he Bloodrage heals
				off a target dying and watch him struggle to stay alive in team fights.</li>
			<li>Blade Mail can be good if you're tanky, especially if he Ruptures you.</li>
			<li>Lotus Orb can provide a lot of value when placed on your carry since BS will feel uneasy about initiating a team fight
				with Rupture.</li>
			<li>Rupture damage is never lethal. You can always walk away when Ruptured no matter how low you get.</li>
			<li>Remember that he's taking extra damage if he has Bloodrage on, so don't be afraid to fight
				back.</li>
			<li>Kiss juking goodbye if there's a Bloodseeker on the enemy team. Once a match you'll find yourself
				wondering, "HOW DID THEY KNOW I WAS THERE???" Then you'll look up and realize that Bloodseeker was
				giving his team global vision of your ass when you're under 25% HP.</li>
			<li>In the same vein, be extremely careful when jungling against an enemy Bloodseeker. If he detects you at
				a dangerous HP, you can be sure that his whole team will be converging to score a kill on you.</li>
