		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Knights have the most unique movement mechanics in the game. Without any buffs, knights can attack pieces
				that would be typically shielded by other pieces.
			</li>
			<li>Know the Fishing Pole Trap.</li>
			<li>Learn the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour">Knight's tour</a> sequence to style
				on opponents when playing with cheats enabled in a private lobby.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Some patzers prefer bishops over knights. Take that exchange every time, knights are way stronger imo.</li>
