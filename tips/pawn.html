		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pawns are the highest skillcap piece in chess. Beginners can pick this piece up instantly, but even GMs
				struggle to play them perfectly.</li>
			<li>Pawns can advance two squares forward if it is the first time the pawn has been moved.</li>
			<li>Pawns are the only piece that capture in a direction differing from their standard movement.</li>
			<li>Pawns have access to a special move called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant"><i>en passant</i></a>.
				This is a capture in which a pawn can capture an opposing pawn on the same rank immediately after the latter has moved forward
				two squares on its first move in the game, as if it had moved forward only one square.</li>
			<li><i>En passant</i> was patched in during the 15<sup>th</sup> century at the same time pawns were given an initial double-step move. These were
				valuable buffs to pawn early and late game development.</li>
			<li>Only pawns are capable of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(chess)">promotion.</a></li>
			<li>You can underpromote pawns to a piece other than a queen. Knight underpromotion can be situationally viable to threaten a check
				or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(chess)">fork</a> where a queen would be unable to.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pawns cannot move backwards.</li>
			<li>Players often toss pawns away due to their low relative point value. Take advantage of such careless play.</li>
