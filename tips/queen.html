		<h1>Tips</h1>

			<li>Not gonna get into queen tips. This piece is overpowered and will probably get nerfed soon.</li>

		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>I don't know what Guptafrog was thinking when this piece was added. It's not balanced at all. Rumor is the next
				patch is adding knight movement to the queen and I'm quitting if that happens.
