		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be aware of the advantages of ground targeting Earth Spike. The cast range is about 300 units shorter
				than the actual range of the stun. Ground targeting also makes it possible to thread the needle between
				heroes, allowing you to potentially land the stun on multiple targets.</li>
			<li>That being said, stop ground targeting Earth Spike when you don't have to. Icefrog's such a nice guy, he
				gives you a mostly guaranteed targeting system for free. There is a special circle in hell for Lions who
				skillshot and whiff Earth Spike on solo targets in targetable cast range.</li>
			<li>Earth Spike will pop Linken's on all targets hit by the projectile. Doesn't matter if you ground targeted
				the spell or not.</li>
			<li>If you a feel a team fight coming on, keep casting and canceling Hex on their initiator. Hexes have 0
				cast time and the moment your target comes into range (like with a Blink Dagger), the spell will get
				cast. If you're worried about Magnus RPing your team, group up all juicy-like, bait his Blink, then
				Frogitize him, Cap'n.</li>
			<li>Hex and Mana Drain are simple spells that quickly kill illusions. Early game this isn't really relevant,
				but when Naga Siren, or Terrorblade, or Chaos Knight start getting fat, this can be useful.</li>
			<li>The 'AoE Hex' and 'Mana Drain Multi Target' talents make you even more effective at clearing illusions.</li>
			<li>Common knowledge, but you can Mana Drain enemy ranged creeps and many jungle creeps.</li>
			<li>Time your Mana Drains on enemy heroes in lane with last hits. If one of your creeps is about to die,
				start Draining. Either they go for the last hit and lose a bunch of mana, or immediately back off and
				lose the last hit.</li>
			<li>Mana Drain is a cheap and long range way to break Linken's Sphere.</li>
			<li>At level 6, Finger of Death deals ~450 damage to a hero with 25% magic resistance. A level 3 Earth Spike+Finger of Death+one auto attack
				deals around ~620 damage. Click on the enemy hero and do the maths to see if you can kill them with your combo.</li>
			<li>You get the Finger of Death bonus damage as long as the target dies within three seconds of getting Fingered. You don't
				have to kill steal everything at 100 HP.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Always be afraid of this guy. He can kill you with relative easeÂ and makes disabling you seem such a
				breeze. If you see him suddenly start walking towards you, he's probably gearing up to Finger you or
				he's setting up for a gank.</li>
			<li>Mana Drain breaks if you go into fog. If he's Draining you in lane, you may be able to stop the Drain
				quicker by going into tree fog rather than running out of the break distance.</li>
			<li>There is an extremely brief (0.25s) moment after Finger of Death connects before the damage is actually dealt.
				You can dodge the damage with banishes from spells or from something like Manta Style if your timing is impeccable.
			</li>
