		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can Grave Chill any non-allied unit. If you see the enemy mid coming to gank you in lane, just Chill
				the nearest creep and make a break for it. If you're trying to catch up to an enemy for a final Soul
				Assumption, Chill a neutral in the jungle to get in range quicker.</li>
			<li>Familiars won't benefit from the Grave Chill speed buff if they're in Stone Form when it's cast.</li>
			<li>Donâ€™t sit on Soul Assumption charges. Instead of struggling to land a Familiar stun in a team fight
				before realizing that they all died in the chaos, worry about using Soul Assumption every time you have
				full bars.</li>
			<li>There are many other ways to use Familiars other than just for keeping you company. Use Brooklyn and
				Lexington to stack ancients, send them to gank a different lane, put them behind a lane and use them to
				distract the next creep wave before a dive.</li>
			<li>In most team fights, you'll usually want to have your Familiars spit on the enemy's squishiest support.
				Not only can these supports not take the abuse, but most don't have a way of easily getting rid of the
				birds either.</li>
			<li>Familiars deal physical damage which make them pair well with minus armor, like Medallion.</li>
			<li>The simplest way to Familiar stun is through unit tabbing. Grave Chill the enemy, tab to a Familiar,
				press Q, tab again, wait around 1 second, Q again, Assume some Souls, get some kills.</li>
			<li>If you and/or your Familiars are taunted (like from Berserker's Call or Winter's Curse), you can force them
				to drop by casting Stone Form from your hero.</li>
			<li>It's often worthwhile to keep a ward on the cliff between the enemy's secret shop and fountain. If you spot
				the courier making its way over, you can try sending your Familiars to snipe it while it's shopping.</li>
			<li>The Familiars can attack Roshan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/8lsm62/you_can_kill_roshan_with_visage_birds_at_level_6/">
				without getting attacked back.</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can't see the countdown, but you can select a Familiar and see how much time is left on the Stone Form buff
				timer.</li>
			<li>Familiars have terrible vision. It's usually safe to assume they have no idea where you are when there aren't any enemy
				heroes around to be their eyes.</li>
			<li>Be aware that Scan will turn red on Familiars (and all other creep-heroes).</li>
			<li>Crimson Guard is an all-purpose-stop-touching-me-Visage item.</li>
