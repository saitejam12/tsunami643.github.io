		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Shards has beastly range, but the projectile travels pretty slow. If you're going for a long range
				Shard, try to save it for when the enemy is moving into a chokepoint or just block the choke in advance.</li>
			<li>The easiest way to 'reverse Shard' yourself is to target the cast of Ice Shards in front of your hero, but inside
				of the green selection circle. With surprisingly little practice you can start cliffing yourself like a pro.</li>
			<li>The Ice Shards projectile provides flying vision as it travels. The vision remains for 2 seconds once they
				reach their destination.</li>
			<li>Thus, you can use the Shards to help get vision of a neutral creep in the jungle to Snowball to if you're
				getting ganked and there are no good targets nearby.</li>
			<li>You, and anyone else in you wrap up, are completely invulnerable when rolling in a Snowball. This means
				that you can use this as a poor man's banish to protect allies if they're about to get killed.</li>
			<li>Think about your Snowball target when trying to save yourself or allies. Don't always target enemy heroes,
				they may move in a way that'll drag you further into a fight. Look for neutrals or lane creeps that
				will take you to more predictable locations when your Snowball ends.</li>
			<li>Snowball isn't blocked by Linken's Sphere.</li>
			<li>You can cast Shards and Tag Team while you're in the Snowball.</li>
			<li>You can pick up new heroes while you're rolling mid-Snowball by right clicking on them.</li>
			<li>You can't Snowball allies that are affected by Black Hole, Chronosphere, or Flaming Lasso.</li>
			<li>Tag Team works on neutrals and Roshan.</li>
			<li>Since the Tag Team bonus damage is calculated as "+green" bonus damage for each attack, you can crit, cleave, and lifesteal off it.</li>
			<li>Tag Team's effects only work on attacks from Tusk, units Tusk owns, allied heroes, and allied illusions (though illusions
				only apply the slow since the damage bonus is "+green" damage). Attacks from units/summons owned by allied heroes don't get any Tag Team bonuses.</li>
			<li>Walrus Punch (and Agh's Kick) breaks channels, even if the enemy is spell immune.</li>
			<li>You can Walrus Punch the courier.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ice Shards is dangerous in lane because of how it affects pathing. You need to add some extra space in
				your safe zone to compensate for it. The distance you have to move to walk out of the Shards doesn't
				seem like much, but you set yourself up for skillshot disables or free harass.</li>
			<li>Tusk and all his allies are invincible in his Snowball, so don't cast your spells until the ball breaks
				apart.</li>
			<li>Tusk can't cast Snowball when rooted.</li>
			<li>Snowball completely ignores Linken's Sphere.</li>
			<li>Lotus Orb will put you in a Snowball targeting Tusk once Tusk's Snowball projectile connects. You can't
				launch this Snowball early, you'll be stuck in it for the full duration.</li>
			</li>
