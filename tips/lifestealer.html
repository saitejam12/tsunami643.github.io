		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're TPing back to base and you have at least 150 mana (75 for Rage, 75 for
				the TP) there are very few situations in which you shouldn't use Rage first before TPing.</li>
			<li>The lifesteal mechanic typically gives you HP in direct correlation with damage dealt to the enemy. Feast
				ignores that and will always heal Naix based off of the max health of the target being attacked. So even
				if you have 0 damage or if the enemy is immune to physical damage, you'll steal heal from Feast.
			</li>
			<li>Avoid initiating team fights with Open Wounds. This skill is your free Satanic. When you're about to
				die, crack Pudge open like a coconut and drink his blood. The slow is useful in 1v1 or gank situations,
				but the massive lifesteal is invaluable in team fights.</li>
			<li>Midasing a creep that has Open Wounds on it will heal you.</li>
			<li>Controlling a creep while Infested won't break the creep's cover. This means that the creep you Infest
				won't change its HP bar in the eyes of the enemy. However, they can still right click your creep like an enemy
				if they know.</li>
			<li>You only gain HP from Consuming neutral or enemy creeps, not allied creeps. However, if you Control an allied
				creep before Consuming them, you <i>will</i> get HP. The trade off is that it'll kill your creep. Heartbreaker.
			</li>
			<li>You can Infest and Control ancient creeps at the 2nd level of Infest.</li>
			<li>Controlling a neutral or lane creep and walking it over to an attackable tier 2 tower will briefly disable its
				backdoor protection.</li>
			<li>Infesting applies a basic dispel on your hero, except it is a rare dispel which also purges off buffs in addition to
				debuffs. So if you grab a double damage rune, you're going to lose it when you Infest an ally.</li>
			<li>You can toggle your Armlet while TPing.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>OH MASTA, LOOK AT ALL THESE SUPPORTS KITING ME. Ghost Scepter, Force Staff, Blink Dagger, and Shiva's
				Guard are all great pickups against a Naix. As is a TP scroll if he hasn't gotten a Basher yet.</li>
			<li>Feast deals bonus damage depending on how high your max HP pool is. It also heals
				Lifestealer based off your max HP pool. As a result, you generally want to avoid building raw HP items against Naix since
				Feast will heal him more and you'll take more damage from his right clicks.</li>
			<li>It's okay to stack stuns on Naix, mainly because Rage has no cast time. Play it safe and just cast your disables early.</li>
			<li>When an ally creep starts walking around weirdly, you can be sure Naix is controlling its mind. The health
				bar may still look green to you, but you <i>can</i> attack the creep and kill it.</li>
			<li>Every initiator becomes twice as fearsome when Naix is on the enemy team. Storm Spirit, Clockwerk,
				Batrider, Io, Nature's Prophet, etc, are all Mk. IV Naix Bombers. Even other units like the Spirit
				Bear, Beastmaster Hawk, Brood Spiders, Lycan Wolves, all become things to fear.</li>
