		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>In addition to casting spells, Treant can use items while he's Nature's Guise'd. This is useful for
				stealthily planting wards in enemy territory or for using a TP while invis and arriving to your destination
				still invis.</li>
			<li>The attack out of Nature's Guise has true strike. The root also disarms and provides true sight on the target for its duration.</li>
			<li>At the max level of Nature's Guise, the root lasts for ~2 seconds and it takes a little more than that to fade back. Sometimes
				you should resist the urge to keep punching someone so that you can go back invis and try to score another root.</li>
			<li>If you're quick, you can Guise-root enemies away from trees by blinking and attacking them during the fade grace time.</li>
			<li>Iron Branch trees work with Nature's Guise.</li>
			<li>Use Leech Seed on a frontline enemy creep to heal your own creeps when pushing.</li>
			<li>Leech Seed will continue pulsing heals even after the target dies.</li>
			<li>The two aspects of Living Armor (the heal and the block) are not separate buffs like with TA's
				Refraction. If you take too many damage instances, you will lose the heal. Assume that all your allies
				are idiots and don't understand how 'damage instances' work and avoid healing teammates when they're
				aggro'd by a bunch of creeps or neutrals.</li>
			<li>Avoid casting Living Armor on a tower unless you know that the enemy creep wave is far away for the same
				reason.</li>
			<li>If you use Living Armor on a tower while it's Glyphed, the damage instances won't tick down.</li>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor through the minimap.</li>
			<li>You can cast Living Armor on the courier.</li>
			<li>There are always occasions when you can be using Living Armor. In the early game, be policing your lanes
				if anyone needs the heal. If no one needs the heal, then see if someone can benefit from the block. If
				no heroes need it, then look at towers. In the late game, when you're struggling for relevance, you can
				always cast it on creeps to ever so slowly help a push.</li>
			<li>Since everyone knows to not BKB/Manta until Overgrowth comes out, you have to play a dangerous game of chicken
				with enemy carries. Most of the time you'll just have to bite the bullet and let the carry break out in a teamfight
				and hope disabling the other enemies is sufficient.</li>
			<li>Overgrowth won't connect on invisible targets, but it will provide true sight on all rooted targets for its duration.</li>
			<li>You can place Agh's Eyes in the Forest on Iron Branch trees. Iron Branch trees last for 20 seconds. This can potentially be useful
				for high ground defenses or sieges where trees are hard to come by.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>It's often worth buying sentries in lane just for Nature's Guise in most games.</li>
			<li>You can see the Living Armor buff on enemy heroes if you click on them to check the number of block
				instances left and the amount of time left.</li>
			<li>DoT spells are good at burning off Living Armor since each damage tick will take off one block
				instance.</li>
			<li>DoT spells are also useful at disabling Treant's fade time into Nature's Guise.</li>
			<li>The Living Armor damage block makes dives against a team with Treant a huge gambit, so be careful with early game
				aggression.</li>
			<li>There's no such thing as chipping down a tower against a Treant thanks to Living Armor's heal. You have to
				commit fully to every tower push, otherwise you're just wasting your time.</li>
			<li>Cast BKB or Manta Style or Lotus Orb or Guardian Greaves or any other dispel <i>after</i> you're Overgrowth'd to break out of it.</li>
			<li>If Treant has an Agh's, you should really carry a Quelling Blade or Battle Fury to chop down
				the Eyes. Force Staff/Hurricane Pike can also work in a pinch.</li>
